# Customizer Typography Control

Sample implementation of a Customizer Typography control in a WordPress theme. This is mostly extracted from Kirki, so full credits to them. It's been modified to suit my needs.

Actual font settings are done in inc/extras.php with the theme_slug_typography_settings() function.
